# Shopify API Wrapper
Forked from Zapiet, moving towards batch requests & better handling of API call limits

### Installing via Composer
The recommended way to install the wrapper is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the latest stable version of the wrapper:

```bash
composer require shopifyextras/shopify-php-api-wrapper
```
After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Getting Started

First you will need to initialise the client like this:

```
$client = Shopify::settings(array(
   "shopUrl" => $shopUrl,
   "X-Shopify-Access-Token" => $accessToken
));
```

Then you can begin making requests:
```
// Get a list of all products.
$client->getProducts();

// Get a list of all orders.
$client->getOrders();

// Get a specific product.
$client->getProduct(array("id" => $product_id));
```

### To-do / Improvements
